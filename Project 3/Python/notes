Output
- Show diagrams of the neurons of the ring at their current location, the connection to their two neighbour neurons, and the location of the TSP cities. 
- Must produce the diagrams at user-specified intervals


Implementation
- Must support static, linear and exponential decay functions for learning rate and neighbourhood radius
- For each dataset, generate at least 3 diagrams to show the status of the SOM at the beginning, middle and at the end of the best run. 
- Illustrate the progress of the TSP by printing out the total distance encoded by the neuron-ring scaffolding (?). This have to be done every k steps of the algorithm, where k is user-specified.
